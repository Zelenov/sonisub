# Create release version

## Release note structure

Every version entry in **version.md** must include **at least one** of `## Added` or `## Changed`.

```markdown
# X.Y.Z
## Added
- short description

## Changed
- short description
```

- **`# X.Y.Z`** — Version as H1 (semver, e.g. `0.4.0`; release tags are `vX.Y.Z`). Must be the
  very first line of the block, and the top block's version must equal `version` in `Cargo.toml`
  (`release.yml` fails otherwise).
- **`# NEXT`** — Unreleased notes on a feature branch. The agent pipeline replaces it with the
  real version, and sets `Cargo.toml` to match, right before merging (`nightly` step 7); `main`
  never carries `# NEXT`.
- **`## Added`** — New features. Omit if nothing added.
- **`## Changed`** — Behaviour changes, fixes, and breaking library API changes (start the line
  with `Library:` and say what callers must change). Omit if nothing changed.

**Which number:** third number for fixes; second number (third back to 0) for new features and
any breaking library API change while the version is 0.x. The version must not exist on
crates.io yet: a published crate version can never be replaced.

**Content guidelines:** User-facing changes only (command line, output files, library API,
Premiere panel). Skip internal refactors unless they affect behaviour. One bullet = one line. Keep
it short.

## Instructions

1. Add a new H1 block at the **top** of version.md (above existing versions).
2. Every version needs at least one of `## Added` or `## Changed`. No empty sections.
3. Never edit a published block's version; fix mistakes in the next version's notes.

## Example

```markdown
# 0.4.0
## Added
- `-t vtt` writes WebVTT subtitles (`clip.vtt`).

## Changed
- Library: `job::Options` has a new field `vtt_styles`; `..Options::default()` keeps the old behaviour.
```

## File

- **version.md** — Single file at repo root. Prepend new version blocks; keep older versions below.
- A change to it on `main` runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`: a GitHub release `vX.Y.Z` whose
  notes are the top block, then crates.io.
